# AWS FinOps Cost Intelligence Dashboard

## Objective
To track and visualize daily AWS service-level spending, identify high-cost services, and uncover cost optimization opportunities using FinOps principles.

---

## Background

Cloud costs can spiral without visibility. By integrating AWS Cost Explorer with visual analytics, this dashboard empowers FinOps teams to monitor usage trends, detect anomalies, and support data-driven cloud budgeting.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **AWS Cost Explorer API (boto3)** â€“ Query cloud spend by service and date.
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib)** â€“ Data wrangling and plotting.
- **Streamlit** â€“ Interactive visual dashboard.
- **CSV Download** â€“ Reporting feature for finance and engineering collaboration.

---

## Architecture

1. Query daily AWS cost data via `boto3.client('ce')`.
2. Group costs by **service type** and **date**.
3. Visualize cost trends and top consumers.
4. Allow CSV export of results.
